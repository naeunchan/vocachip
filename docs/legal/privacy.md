# Privacy Policy (Vocationary)

_Last updated: 2025-02-19_

We collect only the data required to operate the app: local account credentials (stored on your device), search history, and favorites. Data remains on-device unless you choose to export a backup. We do not sell or share personal data with third parties.

## Data We Process

- Account identifiers (email from social login when available): stored locally on your device.
- Usage data: search history and favorites stored locally.
- Diagnostics: optional crash/error reports via Sentry if enabled with a DSN.

## How We Use Data

- Authenticate you locally on the device.
- Show your search history and favorites.
- Improve app stability through crash/error reports (if enabled).

## Storage & Security

- Session/auto-login data is stored in SecureStore/Keychain where available; other data is stored in SQLite on-device.
- Backups you export remain your responsibility; we do not sync to a server.

## Your Choices

- Delete data by removing the app or using “Delete Account” to clear local records.
- Disable crash reporting by omitting the Sentry DSN.
